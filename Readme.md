What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

Ans:
"getElementById" Selects one element by unique ID, returns Element or null, on the other hand "getElementsByClassName" Selects all elements by class, returns live HTMLCollection.
"querySelector" Selects first element by CSS selector, returns Element or null and "querySelectorAll" Selects all elements by CSS selector, returns non-live NodeList.
